<p>In recent years, web development has garnered an astronomical amount of interest, and subsequently, so has computer science. 
  Despite this rise, there are scant resources available online and on the university level that teach web development and computer science interactively. 
  Often times, the resources available do not show how actual, interactive websites work. Furthermore, university level courses on web development do not 
  provide students with proper knowledge to work in industry.</p>

<p>Webeasy.com is a tool provided by the Stevens Institute of Technology Computer Science Department that aims to indulge the interest of our students in web development and design. Here, we introduce the elements that go into building a webpage such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Furthermore, it will most likely provide a helpful feature for prospective Stevens students or lost Freshmen in navigating campus. StevensNavigator would provide the fastest routes to class and would require the use of the Google Maps API.</p>
